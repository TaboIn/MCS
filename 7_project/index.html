                    <h3>Meta Side Table</h3>

                    <li>The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces
                        and well suited to all communal living spaces and bedrooms.
                        Consisting of a series of arranged, powder coated
                        rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s appearance
                        changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full
                        depending on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional
                        storage for your reading material and an even top for decorative
                        accessories.</li>

                    <h3>Click Shelf</h3>
                    <li style="padding: 20px;">
                        Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and
                        construction, as well as the visual lightness, form the 
                        aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm 
                        thin sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the system functions 
                        similar to a construction kit. Only four screws fix the 
                        girder together to which the shelves are simply hung up 
                        without any tools. The material and precision of the 
                        components guarantee the stability and assembly.

                    <h3>Float Shelf</h3>
                    
                    <li>
                        Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is 
                    open to diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside 
                    or side table, bearing weight as wall console, storing a 
                    magazine collection, serving as a compact standing desk, or 
                    safeguarding small personal essentials as a hallway tray. 
                    The Float Shelf equally adds a touch of character to hotel 
                    rooms, boutique accommodation and boardinghouses. Embodying 
                    purity at its most elegant degree, the strict geometry of 
                    this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a sculptural appeal. 
                    The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels cut from a 
                    single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition 
                    allowing for flexible placement, use and display. 
                    Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles of modernism in 
                    the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the essence of a 
                    shelf.
